# OBS Score Counter + Overlay

This App uses PHP, AJAX and XML to create my first attempt at create a HTML scoreboard that is controllable by a score controller. Data on the HTML page is read from a XML file that is updated in real time.

> Whilst not the best app, I am proud that this was my first finished product. Created by me, for me.

## Problems
1. **Static Player's** - Only allows for 6 Players (Also Names are not editable)
2. **Old Frameworks** - Not using up to date code languages
3. **No Database** - Instead of using a XML file, more information can be stored and called as needed

## Version 2.0
This App is currently under redevelopment using NodeJS, EJS, Express and MongoDB.
This will include new features such as:

- Fully editable player controls
- Database addition
- Bootstrap Design framework
